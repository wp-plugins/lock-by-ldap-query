Lock a page down so that it can only be viewed by certain LDAP groups

== Description ==

With this plugin, you can set an LDAP query on a page or post so that only users returned from that query can see the page/post.

If users aren't in the query results, they will see a basic message and you can also set a custom message that will also be displayed. This custom message can contain html and is set on a per page basis, so different pages can have different messages.

Admin users aren't affected by the query results and the blocking is done during the_content, so if a users that can edit the post can still do so.

This was originally created because we had a contact form that we wanted only certain AD users to access. It seemed easier to limit it this way than give out a password to only certain people, hoping they never shared it.

== Installation ==
